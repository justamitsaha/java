Factorial Using Loops — Calculate factorial of a number using iteration.

Check Prime — Check if a number is prime.

Fibonacci Series — Print first N Fibonacci numbers (iteratively and recursively).

🟡 Intermediate Level (OOP, Collections, File Handling)

Focus: object-oriented design, collections API, exceptions, streams.

Employee Class — Create an Employee class with fields like id, name, salary and methods to display info.

Count Word Frequency — Given a sentence, count occurrences of each word using HashMap.

    Sort by Value — Sort a HashMap by its values (ascending order).

Find Duplicates in List — Given a list of integers, find all duplicates using streams or collections.

Remove Nulls from List — Given a list containing nulls, remove them safely.

File Word Count — Read a text file and count how many times each word appears.

Custom Exception — Create a custom exception for invalid age input (< 18).

Reverse LinkedList — Reverse a LinkedList without using built-in reverse methods.

Student Sorting — Create a Student class and sort students by name, then by grade using Comparator.

🔵 Advanced Level (Streams, Concurrency, Design Patterns, Algorithms)

Focus: modern Java, problem-solving, multi-threading.
